# Driver Drowsiness Detection Using Eye State Classification

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting driver drowsiness using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system analyzes eye images to classify eye states as **open** or **closed**, which is a key indicator of driver fatigue. The model is trained using a publicly available Kaggle dataset and is suitable for real-time drowsiness detection applications.
